Permanent: once printed they are "frozen", provide a stable memory of a document historical state, can be destroyed but not altered;
Portable: they are light, can be transported autonomously, can be transferred
hand-to-hand in a social encounter;
Contextualized: they are parts of the physical world, have a material richness
and re-markability, their varied appearance and physical surroundings ensure an abundant mnemonic context.
